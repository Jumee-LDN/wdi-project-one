## Brief
Design a grid base game that works in the users browser. Players must be able to win and lose. The game should be built using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript (jQuery).</br>
**A time limit :**</br>
7 days

## Concept
Inspired by BBC television series Planet Earth, I built a grid-based geography game which requires players to use the arrow keys to save baby iguanas from hungry snakes.

[visit website ](https://jumee-ldn.github.io/wdi-project-one/)to play the game (the game was not designed for mobile).

The score goes up every time when an iguana is on a rocky line and the number goes down when the iguana meets snakes. The game ends when the score goes under 0.
