## Brief
Design a grid base game that works in the users browser. Players must be able to win and lose. The game should be built using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript (jQuery).</br>
**Time limit :** 7 days

## Concept
Inspired by BBC television series Planet Earth, I built a grid-based geography game which requires players to use the arrow keys to save baby iguanas from hungry snakes.

## Goal
Build an initial make-believe BBC game site which could develop further as a whole series of nature documentary inspired games.

## Visuals
parallax.js used.

```javascript

<div id="youtube" class="parallax-window" data-parallax="scroll">
  <div class="videoContainer">
    <iframe class="videoContainer__video" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rv9hn4IGofM?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
```

## The Game
Save iguanas as many as possible. The score goes up every time when an iguana is on a rocky line at the top and the number goes down when the iguana meets snakes. The game ends when the score goes under 0.

## Bugs

- The score goes down to minus.
